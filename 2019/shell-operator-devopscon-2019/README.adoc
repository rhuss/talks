# Kubernetes Operators and how to implement them the Hard Way

* Intro - Setup (Minikube)

* Definition "Operator":

> An operator is a Kubernetes controller that understands two domains: Kubernetes and something else. By combining knowledge of both areas, it can automate tasks that usually require a human operator that understands both domains.

* Goal: Create an operator that restarts an application when its configuration changes

## Controller

* Introduce script

  - Main loop
  - How to watch events (curl explained)
  - How to parse annotations
  - How to create a label selector and delete pods

* Create roles for allowing to watch configmaps and delete pods ("edit" role)
* Put script into config map

* Create dedicated namespace, use `kubens` to switch namespace

```
kubectl create configmap controller-script --from-file=./controller.sh
```

* Create Deployment
  - ServiceAccount
  - Sidecar explained

* Create webapp (without config map) (with NodePort)
* Curl webapp
* Create config map
* Change config map
* Curl webapp

* Delete namespace

## Operator

* Motivation

* Check CRD and apply
* Check CRD role and apply
* Check with `kubectl get cw`
* Review operator.sh
* Apply operator.yml
* Apply webapp.yml with node port
* Curl
* Change ConfigMap
* Curl

* Delete CW and change config map
* Curl
